Week 3 Homework Assignment

## Description
### JavaScript: Password Generator
Create an application that generates a random password based on user-selected criteria. This app will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by your JavaScript code. It will also feature a clean and polished user interface and be responsive, ensuring that it adapts to multiple screen sizes.


## Learning Experience
During this project, I applied many programming concepts such as for loops, do while loops, if else conditions, string indexing. It was a frustrating experience at times, and at other times it was rewarding. I used Chrome's Dev Tools a lot more towards the end, to understand to help me look at my local variables and understand what the current variable was.
